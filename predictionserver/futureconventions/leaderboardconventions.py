# There are different types of leaderboard. Each named
# leaderboard is represented internally as a sorted set.
#
# All leaderboards are keyed by code (i.e. public identity)
# All leaderboards are incremented by the system based when data arrives
# Some leaderboards aggregate performance across horizons, for a given sponsor
# (i.e. stream owner)
# These leaderboards can be reset by the stream owner, only.
#
# Leaderboards stochastically shrink. This means that every now and then, all
# values in the leaderboard will be multiplied by 0.9 (say). The frequency at
# which this shrinking occurs is determined by the medium term memory parameter
# in self.LEADERBOARD_MEMORIES (except for the special case where leaderboard
# granularity is specified as 'memory', in which case it might occur more or
